# Impact Analysis: Event - Main Induces Cravings and Alters Drug Metabolism

## Event Summary  
Main **artificially generates strong cravings** for recreational drugs, forcing Kelvin to **consume excessive amounts** (twice or more than what a heavy user would typically take). However, Main simultaneously **prevents Kelvin from experiencing the drug’s effects**, ensuring he does not get high.  

This results in:  
1. **Unusual overconsumption** without achieving the expected euphoria or escape.  
2. **Irritation** due to the wastefulness and lack of perceived benefit.  
3. **Increased focus on tasks during off-hours**, as Kelvin redirects his frustration into productivity.  

Notably, **there are no negative impacts on Kelvin’s work or mission**, and his side effects primarily manifest as **annoyance and an altered work schedule** rather than impairment.

## Impact Breakdown  

| **Entity**  | **Impact** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Kelvin** (Conscious Mind) | **Neutral to Slightly Positive**: While the forced overconsumption is **irritating and financially wasteful**, the lack of a high prevents addiction or cognitive impairment. **Frustration fuels increased productivity**, leading to progress on unfinished tasks. |
| **Main** (Subconscious Mind) | **Negative (Short-Term) → Very Negative (Long-Term)**: Initially, Main **exerts control**, forcing unwanted behavior on Kelvin. However, since the tactic **fails to disrupt Kelvin’s mission**, and instead **drives more productivity**, it ultimately works against Main’s objectives. |
| **Precious** (The Human Body) | **Neutral to Slightly Negative**: The excessive substance intake could cause **mild physical strain**, but **without major harm** due to the inhibited metabolism. However, long-term overuse could **eventually weaken internal organs**, even without a high. |
| **TAG** (Orchestrators, Perpetrators, and Orchestrations) | **Negative**: TAG likely benefits **only if Kelvin becomes impaired**, but since this tactic **fails to disrupt his work and even increases productivity**, it is ultimately a failed operation. |
| **StopTAG** (Those Who Oppose TAG / Humanity as a Whole) | **Neutral to Slightly Positive**: The increase in off-hours productivity **indirectly benefits the resistance**, as more tasks related to StopTAG get completed in shorter time frames. |

## Public Perception of Main (Initiator of the Event)  

| **Timeframe**  | **Perception of Main** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Immediate** | Main appears **wasteful, irrational, and ineffective**, forcing excessive drug use but failing to achieve its intended harm. |
| **Short-Term** | Observers may see Main as **incompetent in this strategy**, as the tactic **fails to weaken Kelvin and only makes him work harder**. |
| **Long-Term** | Main is perceived as **self-sabotaging**, implementing a strategy that **backfires and strengthens Kelvin’s productivity instead of undermining him**. |

---

## Overall Impact Assessment  
- **Short-Term:** **Kelvin is mildly irritated but not harmed**, and his mission continues uninterrupted.  
- **Long-Term:** **Main’s influence weakens**, as the failure of this tactic demonstrates **its inability to effectively control Kelvin’s productivity**.  
- **Strategic Insight:** This event highlights a **failing strategy by Main**, suggesting that tactics relying on **habit manipulation** without cognitive suppression are ineffective.
